Omitting them can result in a sterile and implausible impression. In this work we present a dataset of spatially recorded ambient sounds with metadata on meteorological and acoustical parameters. The recordings are ready to be admixed with simulated soundscapes corresponding to various weather conditions. In particular, 28 soundscapes have been recorded at the IHTApark (green space next to the Institute for Hearing Technology and Acoustics) in Aachen (Germany) in winter and spring. They have been segmented into 30-s auralizable snippets. Moreover, the database contains a statistical and psychoacoustical evaluation of the recordings.}",

Several research works proposed the Immersive Virtual Reality as tool to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Nevertheless people's perception within virtual environments still needs to be verified. In this study, two groups of participants had to provide subjective measures related to the global, acoustic and visual quality of a real environment or of a multisensory reproduced version in Immersive Virtual Reality. Outcomes highlight the ecological effectiveness of this multisensory tool.}
