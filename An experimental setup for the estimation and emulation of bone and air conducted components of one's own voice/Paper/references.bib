	abstract = {The standardized method for measurement of complex impedances according to {ISO} 10534 Part 2 is applied to the acoustic impedance of the ear with an “open-pinna” condition and with different types of headphones. The method is based on measurement of the transfer function of two microphone locations in an impedance tube and subsequent signal processing of the complex signal spectra. The termination of the tube is interpreted as ear canal entrance, while the measurement direction is, apparently, from “inside” the head towards outside. A tube which was specifically designed for this purpose works well, even though extremely small impedances must be measured. The impedances of the free pinna are similar to the “soft” end condition in the open tube, approximately following the radiation impedance of a piston into free space. The headphone impedances can be separated according to the type of headphone. In addition, the absolute impedances as the differences to the open ear compared with a number of headphones are interesting and may be starting point for further investigations. One possibility is, of course, quality control of headphones. The results are also expected to be useful for psychoacoustic research, for better understanding of sound perception, and for use in development of audio equipment.},

	abstract = {The occlusion effect is commonly experienced by in-ear device wearers as an increased loudness sensation of bone-conducted low frequency sounds. A widespread theory proposed by Tonndorf and based on a simplified electro-acoustic model describes the phenomenon as the removal of the open earcanal high-pass filter effect due to a perfect or partial occlusion. However, this filter has not been clearly defined and several ambiguities remain. Revisiting the model, a second order high-pass filter effect for the volume velocity transferred between the earcanal wall and the eardrum is highlighted. This filter remains for partial occlusion but vanishes for perfect occlusion. In the latter case, the volume velocity transferred from the earcanal cavity to the middle ear through the eardrum drastically increases, which explains the predominance of the occluded outer ear pathway on the hearing by bone-conduction at low frequencies.},

	abstract = {It is a well-known fact that both bone-conducted and air-conducted sound contribute to the perception of one's own voice. As early as 1949 Békésy described experiments which were aimed at estimating the ratio of the two components' contributions.In this article investigations
are described which quantitatively analyse the influences of air conduction, bone conduction and of the reflections on the sound of a person's own voice. Different methods for measuring the components were applied. Concerning the air conduction, direct measurements of sound propagation from
the mouth to the ears around the head were performed. As the bone conduction cannot be measured directly, psychoacoustic methods based on masking effects were used to evaluate this component. The reflections in a room can be modelled by methods that apply geometric acoustics. The results of
the measurements are compared to those of related investigations reported in literature. Finally, it is discussed to which extent one's own voice should be considered in auditory virtual environments.},

This relation is important for hearing impaired subjects as a hearing aid affects these two parts differently and thereby changes the perception of one’s own voice. A large ear-muff that minimized the occlusion effect while still attenuating {AC} sound was designed. During vocalization and wearing the ear muff the ear-canal sound pressure could be related to the {BC} component of a person’s own voice while the {AC} component was derived from the sound pressure at the entrance of an open ear-canal. The {BC} relative to {AC} sensitivity of one’s own voice was defined as the ratio between these two components related to the ear-canal sound pressure at hearing thresholds for {BC} and {AC} stimulation. The results of ten phonemes showed that the {BC} part of one’s own voice dominated at frequencies between 1 and 2 {kHz} for most of the phonemes. The different phonemes gave slightly different results caused by differences during vocalization. However, similarities were seen for phonemes with comparable vocalization.},

 was measured with a custom-made program that performed frequency averaging to reduce response variability. Participants also repeated the phrase "Baby Jeannie is teeny tiny" and rated their own voice. The results showed a systematic change in the objective {OE} and subjective ratings
 of {OE} as the vent diameter was modified. Furthermore, a significant correlation was seen between subjective rating and objective occlusion effect. El actual estudio re-examinó el efecto de los diferentes diámetros en el orificio de ventilación sobre el efecto de oclusión

 para producir, para el estudio, dispositivos de inserción de auxiliares auditivos completamente en el canal ({CIC}). Esto se hizo para minimizar cualquier fuga de hendidura de los insertos. Las dimensiones de orificio de ventilación fueron sistemáticamente alteradas durante
 el estudio. Los participantes produjeron una /i/ sostenida por 5 segundos, y se midieron las respuestas ocluidas de oído real con un programa hecho a la medida que realizaba promediaciones de la frecuencia para reducir la variabilidad en la respuesta. Los participantes también
 repitieron la frase "Baby Jeannie is teeny tiny" y calificaron su propia voz. Los resultados mostraron un cambio sistemático en las apreciaciones objetivas y subjetivas del {OE} conforme se modificó el tamaño del orificio de ventilación. Más aún,
